# Education Landing Page (React)

This project is a responsive education Home/landing page built with React.  
It was created to translate a Figma design into clean, structured, and reusable React components while paying close attention to layout, spacing, and responsiveness.

The focus of this project is not just how it looks, but how the code is organised and easy to maintain.
